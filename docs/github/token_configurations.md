# Github Token(s) Generation
In order to work with Developer Hub and GitHub integrations, you will need to extract a personal access token (i.e., PAT) and an application, via which 
you can integrate with GitHub.
Official GitHub documentation to get these tokens can be found over here:
* Create git app:

  * https://backstage.io/docs/integrations/github/github-apps/
* Create personal access token:
